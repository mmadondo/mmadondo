### Hi there 👋

My name is Malvern Madondo and I am a third-year Computer Science PhD student at Emory University. I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science/Info Systems and Mathematics at The College of St. Scholastica. I’m currently working on research at the intersection of reinforcement learning and optimal control, with applications in neuroscience.
