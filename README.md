# Malvern Madondo

Research Scientist at the [University of Chicago](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/) · Department of Radiation & Cellular Oncology

I develop AI-driven treatment planning algorithms at the intersection of **deep reinforcement learning**, **optimal control**, and **clinical oncology**. My current work focuses on automatic treatment planning for radiotherapy modalities using patient-specific RL frameworks.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Emory University, where I was advised by [Dr. Lars Ruthotto](https://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~lruthot/) and supported by a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/?filtertab=2021) in Computational Neural & Cognitive Sciences.

### Research Interests

- **AI for Radiation Therapy** — deep RL for proton therapy treatment planning (head-and-neck cancer)
- **Closed-loop Biomedical Control** — neuromodulation via Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics, glycemic control via Bergman minimal model
- **Optimal Control + ML** — neural ODEs, Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations
- **Fairness in Healthcare AI** — equitable treatment strategies across diverse patient populations
