### 👋 Hi there!

My name is Malvern Madondo and I am a Computer Science researcher specializing in machine learning and applied math in biomedicine. I recently earned my PhD in Computer Science from Emory University, following my undergraduate studies in Computer Science/Information Systems and Mathematics at The College of St. Scholastica.

Currently, I am advancing my research at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control, focusing on adaptive treatment interventions in critical areas such as radiation therapy, glucose regulation, and neuromodulation.
